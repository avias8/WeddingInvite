          Once upon a time in the vibrant city of Calgary, two paths crossed
          that were destined to intertwine. Avi, a dreamer with a passion for
          technology, and Shakthi, a creative spirit with a love for life,
          found each other in the most serendipitous way. Together, they
          embarked on a journey filled with love, laughter, and adventure.

          From their first coffee date to late-night stargazing, every moment
          brought them closer. Now, as they take the next step in their
          beautiful journey, they invite you to join them in celebrating their
          love story.
